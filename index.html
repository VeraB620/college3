	<h1>Introduction</h1>
    	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#1047;&#1044;&#1088;&#1072;&#1074;&#1089;&#1090;&#1074;&#1091;&#1081;&#1090;&#1077;; that is hello in Russian. I am Vera Beilinson and if you are here, then you probably want to know more about me. I live in River Forest, IL, right outside of Chicago. I was born into a Russian family with two sisters. There is a large difference in ages between my sisters and I, the smallest gap is six years. From my sisters, I have learned a lot out life and growing up, the most important being to stay positive and loving life.

    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a big dreamer. I want to find a way to convert car exhaust back into gas, solve the fresh water problem,  discover a new species of animal, open a hotel in India, travel across the Australian desert, and inspire people.
        For now, I know I am meant to become a computer scientist.
        I love to code websites like this, for it is a unique type of art that also requires logic. It can also change the world if used in the right way.

        <h1>Why Computer Science?</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer science is one physical art of the science world. It is a blend of logic, creativity, and math that makes the field so intriguing. Also, one can physically see the results, its is not theoretical. Since the world had developed into one dependent on technology and since technology has advanced the world, computer science is the perfect way to help change the world. With computer science, I can choose exactly how I want to use it; I could use it in any field.</br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from wanting to do computer science, I would love to help encourage women to join the STEM fields. Sadly, there are less women in the science and mathematics fields, especially engineering, than males. In my first computer programming class, I was the only female. I think this is because women still feel inferior to men. It is important to encourage females to go into the field for ever evolving fields need a constant pair of fresh new eyes.

     <div class="music">
    <h1>Music</h1>
    <p> I always wanted to be a rock star. Starting at a young age, I played classical piano but then quit, since I liked to create my own music. I moved onto guitar. I joined a Jazz Band, called Blues Democracy. We have played at restaurants and at Forest Park Summerfest. I am the keyboardist and occasional guitar player. I am also a self taught ukulele, french horn, and accordion player.
        Music has helped me continue my creativity and help me feel more in sync with my mind.</p>

<div class="travel">
        <h1>Travel and Adventure</h1>
        <p>My whole life I have been traveling. I have been all over Europe. I also have been to Mexico, the Virgin Islands, China, and Canada. Travel is important to immerse yourself in a new culture. When I travel, I do a lot of crazy things like scuba diving, paragliding, and going into caves. I like to the see the world in different angles, for when you are just on the ground, you only see the world in one way. You have to explore to see life in a new way, a more beautiful way.</p>

    <!--Chinese-->
    <div class="chinese">
    <h1>Chinese</h1>
    <p>My mom forced me to take Chinese my freshman year of high school, but I am glad she did. Chinese is an amazing language. The characters are beautiful, and each one has a story, like the character for home is a pig under a roof (thus home is where you can be a pig). Chinese has opened me up to the very cool culture of China. I was even able to go on my school's China trip; it was a huge culture change. I am now a co-president of my schools Chinese Cultural Society. We do activities (like movies, cook dumpling, tea ceremonies, visit China Town) to learn more about the culture. I am glad to help students learn more about the ancient world of China.</br> I also have received 2nd place in the Valparaiso University's Fifth Annual High School Chinese Speech Contest.</p>

    <!--Learning-->
    <div class="learning">
    <h1>Learning</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love to learn, so I have taken many classes outside of school. I have taken architecture, bio-mechanics, intro to engineering, marine biology, and HTML/CSS. In biomechanics, a three day class, we designed a new scuba suit inspired from animals from the Shedd Aquarium and from the bio-mechanics exhibit in the Field Museum.</br>
    In "Intro to Engineering", a one week camp, I learned a little about a few types of engineering, my favorite being materials.
    </br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In marine biology, a two week school summer enrichment class, we traveled to Florida. We snorkeled in the Keys, did labs, and had classes. It was an amazing adventure, but a lot of hard work.</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My HTML/CSS class was a CTD Northwestern summer camp (like my architecture class). I was surprised I was the only female. It was the best class ever. We got to meet amazing coders, like the creators of Cards Against Humanities and the head of Google in Chicago. It was an amazing experience, with lasting friendships. Now I can't stop coding! How do you think I made this website?!</p>
