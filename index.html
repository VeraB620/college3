I was born into a Russian family with two older sisters. From my sisters, I have learned a lot about life and growing up, the most important being to stay positive and to love life.

    	</br>
    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a big dreamer. I want to find a way to convert car exhaust back into gas, to solve the fresh water problem, to discover a new species of animals, to open a hotel in India, to travel across the Australian desert, to and inspire people, as so many people have inspired me.
        For now, I want to become a computer scientist.

        <h1>Why Computer Science?</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer science is one physical art of the science world. It is a blend of logic, creativity, and math that makes the field so intriguing. I love to code websited like this, for it a unique blend of art that required logic&ndash;it's a combination of the academic and artistic sides of me.
            Also, one can physically see the results, its is not theoretical. Since the world had developed into one dependent on technology and since technology has advanced the world, computer science is the perfect way to help change the world. With computer science, I can choose exactly how I want to use it; I could use it in any field.</br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from wanting to do computer science, I would love to help encourage women to join the STEM fields. Sadly, there are less women in the science and mathematics fields, especially engineering, than males. In my first computer programming class, I was the only female. I think this is because women still feel inferior to men. It is important to encourage females to go into the field for ever evolving fields need a constant pair of fresh new eyes.

     <div class="music">
    <h1>Music</h1>
    <p> I have always had music in my life. Starting at a young age, I have played classical piano, and have since picked up more instruments and have begun creating my own music. The next instrument I picked up was the guitar. I joined a jazz band called Blues Democracy. We have played at restaurants and a local summerfest. I am the keyboardist and occasional guitar player. I am also a self-taught ukulele, French horn, and accordion player.
        Music has helped me continue my creativity and help me feel more in sync with my mind.</p>

<div class="travel">
        <h1>Travel and Adventure</h1>
        <p>My whole life I have been traveling. I have been all over Europe, Mexico, the Virgin Islands, China, and Canada. Immersing myself in a new culture is my favorite thinga about traveling. When I travel, I always try to do things I haven't done before or that I cannot do at home like scuba diving, paragliding, and going into caves. I like to the see the world in different angles, for when you are just on the ground, you only see the world in one way. You have to explore to see life in a new way, a more beautiful way.</p>

    <div class="chinese">
    <h1>Chinese</h1>
    <p>My mom suggested that I take Chinese my freshman year of high school, I initially wasn't thrilled about the idea, but I am glad she did. Chinese is an amazing language. The characters are beautiful, and each one has a story, like the character for home is a pig under a roof (thus home is where you can be a pig). Chinese has opened me up to the very cool culture of China. I was even able to go on my high school's China trip and it was a huge culture change. I am now a co-president of my schools Chinese Cultural Society. We do activities (like watch movies, cook dumpling, perform tea ceremonies, and visit China Town) to learn more about the culture. I am glad to help students learn more about the ancient world of China.</br> I also have received 2nd place in Valparaiso University's Fifth Annual High School Chinese Speech Contest.</p>

    <!--Learning-->
    <div class="learning">
    <h1>Learning</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love to learn, so I have taken many classes outside of school. I have taken architecture, bio-mechanics, intro to engineering, marine biology, and HTML/CSS. In biomechanics, a three day class, we designed a new scuba suit inspired from animals from the Shedd Aquarium and from the bio-mechanics exhibit in the Field Museum.</br>
    In &quot;intro to engineering&quot;, a one-week camp, I learned a little about a few types of engineering, my favorite being material engineering.
    </br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In marine biology, a two-week school summer enrichment class, we traveled to Florida. We snorkeled in the Keys, performed laboratory experiments, and took classes. Although it was a lot of hard work, it was an amazing adventure that I would gladly do again.</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My HTML/CSS class was a Center for Talent Development (CTD) summer camp at Northwestern (like my architecture class). I was very surprised that I was the only female. It was the best class ever. We got to meet amazing coders, like the creators of Cards Against Humanities and the head of Google in Chicago. It was an amazing experience, with lasting friendships. Now I can't stop coding! How do you think I made this website?! That experience has made me appreciate the power of computer programming, and has inspired me more to become a woman in the field.</p>
